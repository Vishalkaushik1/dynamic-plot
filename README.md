# Dynamic Graph Project - FIFA Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of the FIFA dataset, examining player attributes, performance, and market values from 2015 to 2020. The dataset includes player-specific information such as Overall Rating, Potential, Club, Value, Wage, and various skills and characteristics. The goal is to gain insights into player trends, visualize the data dynamically, and share valuable information.

## Project Structure

### Data Analysis Script (fifa_dataset_analysis.ipynb):

Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for loading, cleaning, and analyzing the FIFA dataset.

Dynamic graph creation using Plotly and Seaborn libraries.

In-depth exploration of player attributes, market values, and overall performance over the years.

Dynamic graphs and visualizations generated from the analysis.

### Graphs and Visualizations:

Examples include scatter plots, time-series plots, and correlation matrices.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
2. Change to the project directory:
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to perform the analysis:

## Results

The project provides a comprehensive analysis of the FIFA dataset, showcasing trends, correlations, and patterns in player attributes and market values. The dynamic graphs offer an interactive way to visualize and interpret the FIFA dataset over the specified period.

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate additional datasets for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Implement machine learning models for predictive analytics.
- Enhance interactivity in dynamic graphs for user-friendly exploration.
